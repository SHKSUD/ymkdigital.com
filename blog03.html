                <p>You're running ads. You're getting clicks. Your email list is growing. But your <em>revenue</em> isn't. You're stuck in the "trash lead" trap: a funnel full of people who click but never buy.</p>

                <p>Here's the hard truth: <strong>More leads is not the answer. <em>Better</em> leads are.</strong></p>

                <h3>The Problem: A Leaky Bucket</h3>
                <p>A funnel optimized for <em>quantity</em> will always produce trash leads. This happens when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your lead magnet is too broad (e.g., "Win a free iPad!").</li>
                    <li>Your ad copy promises a "quick fix" that attracts impatient people.</li>
                    <li>You have no qualification process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Fix: Add <em>Friction</em></h3>
                <p>This sounds counter-intuitive, but you need to <strong>selectively</strong> add friction to weed out the uncommitted.</p>

                <h4>1. Be Hyper-Specific in Your Offer</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Bad:</strong> "Download our free marketing guide."<br>
                    <strong>Good:</strong> "Download our guide to acquiring 5+ new clinical patients per week."
                </blockquote>
                <p>The second one repels everyone <em>except</em> clinicians. That's the point.</p>

                <h4>2. Use a "Nurture" Sequence</h4>
                <p>Don't just send your lead magnet. Send a 3-5 part email sequence that teaches, builds trust, and asks for a small commitment. People who unsubscribe were never going to buy. Let them go.</p>

                <h4>3. Qualify Before the Call</h4>
                <p>Your time is your most valuable asset. Don't waste it on "discovery calls" with unqualified leads. Use your Calendly link (like on my homepage!) to ask qualifying questions <em>before</em> they can book.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Questions to ask:</strong> "What is your current monthly revenue?" "What is your budget for this project?" "What is your timeline?"</li>
                    <li>If they don't meet your minimum, redirect them to a free resource. You've still helped them, but you've protected your time.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <hr>
                
                <p>Stop a "growth at all costs" mindset. Focus on <strong>quality</strong>. You'll have fewer leads, but more customers.</p>
